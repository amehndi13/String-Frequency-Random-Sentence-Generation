This is a C++ project that uses containers and make use of randomization.

In order to test my code please follow these steps. I have created the desired output files
that my programs should generate based on the test files which test different cases. The test
code just makes sure that my desired output files are also the files that my program creates.

Testing hw4a
1. run the command make hw4a
2. run the command ./hw4a a < test1a.txt > output1a.txt
3. run the command ./hw4a a < test2a.txt > output2a_versiona.txt
4. run the command ./hw4a c < test2a.txt > output2a_versionc.txt
5. run the command ./hw4a r < test2a.txt > output2a_versionr.txt
6. run the command make test_hw4a
7. run the command ./test_hw4a (this should print success to the console)

Testing hw4b
1. run the command make hw4b
2. run the command ./hw4b 10 < test1b.txt > output1b.txt
3. run the command ./hw4a 10 < test2b.txt > output2b.txt
6. run the command make test_hw4b
7. run the command ./test_hw4b (this should print success to the console)
